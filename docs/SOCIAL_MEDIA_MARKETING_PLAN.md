# Social Media Marketing Module: "Nutri Authority AI"
**Focus**: Empowering the Brazilian Nutritionist to become a recognized authority on Instagram/TikTok without burnout.

## 1. Executive Summary
**Project Name**: *Nutri Authority AI* (Módulo de Autoridade Digital)
**Goal**: To turn a "shy" or "busy" Nutri into a consistent content creator. The AI acts as their **Personal Social Media Manager**, handling strategy, scripting, design, and ethics.
**Philosophy**: "Don't be an influencer. Be an Authority." (Addressing the fear of looking "futil" or "blogueirinha").

## 2. Market Analysis: The Brazilian Context
- **The Problem**: Nutris know they *need* to post, but they:
    1.  **Freeze**: "What do I say today?"
    2.  **Fear**: "What if the Conselho (CFN) fines me?"
    3.  **Fail**: They post technical textbook photos that get 2 likes.
- **The Opportunity**: Brazil has one of the highest social media usages in the world. Patients *search* for their Nutri on Instagram before booking. An empty profile = no trust.
- **Key Cultural Hooks**:
    - **"Caixinha de Perguntas"**: The #1 way to build engagement in Brazil.
    - **Trends**: BBB (Big Brother), Memes, Novelas.
    - **Authority vs. Blogueira**: Nutris want to be seen as *Doctors*, not *Models*.

## 3. The "Nutri Authority" Module: Features

### A. The "Content Calendar Generator" (Niche-Specific)
**How it works**: The Nutri selects their niche (e.g., *Emagrecimento Feminino*, *Hipertrofia*, *Materno-Infantil*).
**AI Output**: A 30-day content calendar is generated instantly.
- *Monday*: Myth-busting ("Carbs at night?").
- *Tuesday*: Technical deep-dive (simplified).
- *Wednesday*: "Patient Story" (Anonymized).
- *Thursday*: TBT / Personal hobby (Human connection).
- *Friday*: "Caixinha" prompts.

### B. The "Reels Teleprompter" & Scriptwriter
**Pain Point**: "I hate recording video."
**Solution**:
- **Hook Generator**: AI writes the first 3 seconds to stop the scroll. *"Para de comer tapioca achando que é fit!"* (Stop eating tapioca thinking it's fit!).
- **Script**: Bullet points or full text.
- **Teleprompter Mode**: The app actually scrolls the text while the camera records.

### C. The "Ethical Guardian" (CFN Shield)
**Strict Safety Layer**: Before any post is "Approved", the AI scans it against the **Código de Ética e Conduta do Nutricionista**.
- **Blocks**: "Antes e Depois" (Before/After) images.
- **Blocks**: Promises of "Cure" or specific weight loss numbers.
- **Suggests**: "Change *'Lose 5kg'* to *'Reach your healthy weight'*".

### D. "Trend Jacking" (O Espião de Trends)
**Feature**: The AI monitors Brazilian Twitter/Instagram trends.
- **Scenario**: A celebrity talks about "Ozempic".
- **Action**: Alert the Nutri: *"Hot Topic! Dr. Ana, record a 60s video explaining the risks of Ozempic for non-diabetics. Here is the script."*
- **Result**: Instant relevance.

### E. The "Design Studio" (Canva Killer)
**Template Engine**: Professional, minimalist, medical-grade templates.
- No "comic sans".
- Auto-generate Carousels (Carrosséis) from long text. "5 benefits of Creatine" -> 5 swipeable slides.
